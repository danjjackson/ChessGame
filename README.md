# Chess

## Installation
This project uses **poetry** to manage its dependencies. To install poetry simply follow the installation guide [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

Once poetry is installed you can run `poetry install` to install the dependencies.

To then play chess all you have to do is run `poetry run python main.py` and away you go!

## Playing Chess
The UI will first prompt you for name and rating of the two people playing. You can then enter moves using standard chess notation (eg e4, Nf3, Bxc4, Qa4+ etc).
